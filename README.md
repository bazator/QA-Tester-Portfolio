## About me
I work in IT support and data analysis and I also take on occasional software testing tasks.  
I’m a self-learner in testing, building my skills through online courses and practice, and applying them whenever possible at work.  

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Warsaw University of Life Sciences.
I enjoy solving technical problems, digging into details, finding bugs and making systems more reliable. 
I’m continuously developing my skills in QA, automation, and data science.  

**I’m open to roles in QA, testing, IT support, and other areas where I can use my technical skills and keep learning.**
